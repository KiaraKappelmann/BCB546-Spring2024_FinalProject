# Final Project - Figure 1

Figure 1 is a scatter plot of the amount of Mg25 and Cd111 for 24 of the genotypes between the 2010 and 2011 harvest years.

## Load Packages

```{r load packages}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Data Manipulation

```{r select data}

selected_data <- select(full.data, 3:22, 26, 27) # Select only the data necessary to generate the scatter plots
head(selected_data)
```

```{r mean data}

mean_values <- selected_data %>% # Create new data frame with mean values from all the data in the selected data frame 
  group_by(Genotype, Year) %>% # Group the selected data by genotype and year
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) # Calculate the mean values for each element based on the genotype and year
```

```{r remove genotypes}
genotypes_to_remove <- c("IL14H", "HP301", "P39") # Create a vector of genotypes to remove
final_values <- mean_values %>% # Assign filtered data to a new data frame
  filter(!Genotype %in% genotypes_to_remove) # Filter mean_values data frame by every genotype that is not in the genotypes_to_remove vector

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
