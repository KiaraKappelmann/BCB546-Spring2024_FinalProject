# Final Project

## Original Paper

We chose to re-create the data from the paper found here: <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087628>

The original paper has three figures, but we chose to create a few of our own figures from the data since we had six group members.

## Data

The original data files can be found in the `Data` folder. These files were used to re-create the plots.

## Code

All the code we used can be found in `Code` folder.

## Visualizations

Final figures can be found in the `Visualizations` folder.
