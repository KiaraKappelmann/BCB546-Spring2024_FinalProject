# Final Project

## Original Paper

We chose to re-create the data from the paper found here: <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087628>

The original paper has three figures, but we chose to create a few of our own figures from the data since we had six group members.

## Data

The original data files can be found in the `Data` folder. These files were used to re-create the plots.

## Code

All the code we used can be found in `Code` folder.

### Figure 1

The final code used to generate figure 1 can be found in the `Figure1.Rmd` file. The `Figure1_FinalProject.R` file contains the crude code troubleshooting that was used to generate the final .Rmd file. The `Figure1.Rmd` file contains all the descriptions of the code in markdown text and how the data was formatted to create figure 1. 

## Visualizations

Final figures can be found in the `Visualizations` folder. 

### Figure 1

The final file for figure 1 is the `Figure1.png` file. An additional figure was generated from the data used to make figure 1 that visualizes all 20 elements at once. This file can be found as `Figure1_all_elements.png`.
